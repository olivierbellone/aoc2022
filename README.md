# aoc2022

My solutions for Advent of Code 2022. Going with Crystal this year :)

## Installation

No idea how you'd install this, or why you'd want to really.

## Usage

Invoke the binary with the day number as the first argument, and the input file as the second argument.

E.g. to compute the solutions for the first day's puzzles:
```sh
aoc2022 1 input/day1.txt
```
